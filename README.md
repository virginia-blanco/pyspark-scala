## Where are you from

I am from Spain, but I am currently living in Chicago. I have also studied 10th grade in the US, specifically at DePaul Catholic in New Jersey.

## IT Interest
I really love everything related to programming, as I like how you can use your creativity to think of a solution to a problem and your logic to solve the problem with a programming language. Among programming, my favorite fields are software development and machine learning.

## First Computing Device

My first computing device was the Nokia XpressMusic 5200, with the amazing game of Snake.
